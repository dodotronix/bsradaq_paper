\begin{abstract}
    The LHC Abort Gap Monitor (AGM) is part of the LHC machine protection
    system (MPS) and is designed to measure the particle population in a 3us
    wide region known as the "abort gap." This region needs to be kept empty to
    ensure safe beam dumps. The AGM captures the synchrotron light generated in
    the visible part of the spectra and converts it into an electric signal.
    This signal is then processed by an acquisition system and can trigger the
    ‘abort gap cleaning’ process. The current AGM, which has been in operation
    since 2010, uses an analogue integrator ASIC and a 40 MHz
    analogue-to-digital (ADC) converter to provide the particle population
    information. However, this solution is now considered obsolete and is being
    replaced by a digital signal processing approach. Working directly in the
    digital domain not only offers more scalability but also better determinism
    and reliability. This work presents the new technical solution for the
    acquisition chain, compares the characteristics of both implementations,
    and showcases recent measurements conducted on the LHC ion and proton
    beams.

\section{Introduction}
During the flat-top phase, the LHC ring stores up to \SI{350}{MJ} of beam energy,
spread across 2808 bunches with an average beam transverse size under
\SI{1}{mm}. This high energy density can melt metallic surfaces and quench
superconducting magnets, posing a risk to the machine~\cite{LHC_report}. 
To safely extract the beam from the vacuum compartments, a series of kicker
magnets belonging to the beam dump system is used. These magnets take 3 us to
ramp up their magnetic field~\cite{beam_dump_system}. This defines the size of
an abort gap (AG) in the bunch train. Due to system imperfections, particles
populate this gap. Average AG population is in order of $10^{9}$ particles. The
population in a single bunch is four orders of magnitude higher in comparison.
When the beam dump is initiated, the particles in AG do not receive full
extraction force. That causes deflection towards the vacuum chamber. When a
certain energy accumulates in the AG, the magnet can quench. Therefore,
continuous monitoring of the AG population is necessary, which is the purpose
of the AGM~\cite{particles_in_ag}.\\
This paper reviews the upgrade of the current AGM system in the LHC since 2010,
focusing on system architecture, analog electronics chain, temperature
dependence, timing instabilities, and a comparison with the upgraded system.

\section{System architecture}
The system comprises three main parts. The first part is the optical front-end
(OF), which includes a preamplifier positioned beneath the vacuum chamber. The
second part is a data acquisition system (DAQ) deployed on an FPGA platform
located outside the radiation area. The third part involves software (SW) that
retrieves, interprets, and presents the measured data, facilitating interaction
with the instrument. The system architecture is illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:bsra_chain}, with each part labeled accordingly.
\begin{figure}[!tbh]

    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{bsra_chain.pdf}
    \caption{BSRA Chain}
    \label{fig:bsra_chain}
\end{figure} 
The diagram on the left depicts the layout of the LHC, with beam 1 represented
in red and beam 2 in blue. It includes all four experiments (Alice, Atlas,
LHCb, and CMS). The AGM is situated at Point 4 (indicated by the yellow
square), close to the CMS experiment. The Timing, Trigger, and Control system
(TTC) is shown as a purple rectangle in the center of the LHC ring. This system
receives RF clocking and broadcasts it as messages on the network (TTC
distribution)~\cite{ttc_distribution}. The AGM extracts bunch clock information
(corresponding to the position of bunches) and turn clock information (marking
the start of a turn) from these messages.\\
Beam intensity is gathered by measuring the synchrotron light (SL), as
indicated by the red line directed towards the Multi-channel photomultiplier
(MCP-PMT) in the optical front-end (OF). The beam travers first optical
filters, which increase system dynamic range. Subsequently, the signal is
transmitted over a \SI{100}{m} cable. To compensate for losses in the cable,
the signal is amplified beforehand. It then proceeds to the Data Acquisition
(DAQ) system, which measures \SI{6.4}{\micro\second} window and integrates the
intervals of \SI{100}{\nano\second}. This creates set of 64 values published to
the SW every \SI{10}{\micro\second}.

\subsection{Working principle}
The measurement period is determined by the MCP-PMT used, which is the gated
HAMAMATSU R5916U-50 with a duty cycle of \SI{1}{\%}. With a gate pulse duration
of \SI{3}{\micro\second} and one turn cycle length of \SI{89}{\micro\second},
measurements are taken every 4th clock cycle (\SI{356}{\micro\second}),
reducing the duty cycle to \SI{0.84}{\%}.\\
The system captures 64 values with a granularity of \SI{100}{\nano\second}. The
MCP-PMT gate duration is \SI{3}{\micro\second} providing an additional degree of
freedom in system control. Each \SI{100}{\nano\second} value is averaged in an
extra EMA and provided to the software every \SI{100}{\micro\second}. This
time is enough to react to changes in AG. The population can change from
\SI{1.6}{\second} to \SI{25}{\second} due to different
effects~\cite{high_sensitivity_measurement}.

\subsection{Current Solution}
The current solution uses DAB64x card deploying FPGA Altera Stratix EP1S40. The
platform has two FMC connectors. There are mounted two IBMS module. Those
modules integrate voltage on input using ASIC lhcb2002b~\cite{lhcb_asic}.
To get the maximal resolution of the ADC, the signal is amplified by HAMAMATSU
C5594 with static gain \SI{36}{dBV}, bandwith \SI{1.5}{GHz} and the low cutoff
frequency 50kHz.
\begin{figure}[!tbh]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{existing_system_processing.pdf}
    \caption{Current system block diagram}
    \label{fig:current_system_processing}
\end{figure}
The system schematic is in Fig.~\ref{fig:current_system_processing}. The OF is
the same as described in the system architecture chapter. The picture omits the
filters, because they are used in all cases. The MCP-PMT signal needs to be
amplified by at least 34dB to use the full scale of the 40Mhz ADC. The
Hamamatsu C559 is used~\cite{bsra_first_operation}. The signal belonging
to one bunch (\SI{25}{ns}) is integrated in the IBMS (blue triangle with a
capacitor in the feedback) sampled by ADC (violet rectangle in the figure). The
DAQ integrates 4 samples (light blue rectangle with $\sum$ symbol) to calculate
charge in \SI{100}{ns} interval. It produces 64 values, from which are created
two sets of 64 values with the standard deviation and the mean value is
calculated. Both sets are passed to the EMA block (green rectangle in
the figure). All data are saved in the block ram. This is is than shared with
the PC over wishbone to VME64 bridge. The PC runs server which provides the
FESA interface to the connected clients. 

\subsection{Constraints and Limitations}
The current AGM returns artefacts in the measurements. The signal, which lays
outside of the gate is not reflecting behaviour of white noise. This is caused
by the lhcb2002b ASIC. The integrators gain is not linear, have different
offset and dead times. This means, that system needs to correct at each
integrator these effects, which creates uncertainties in the results. This
results in complicated calibration procedur.\\
The system uses old FPGA platform for which development sofware tools are not
compatible with newest operation systems. The amplifier is not variable, which
results in lower resolution for smaller magnitudes.

\section{System Upgrade}
To resolve the issue of the maintenance, the VFC-HD carrier is used with
additional RTM board providing driver for the gate and control of the built-in
test LED. The same carrier board with 500MSPS 14-bit ADC has been used in other
projects and so it provided the requirement for reducing the maintenance efford.
The new system removes IBMS cards with lhcb2002b integrators and moving the
whole integration process to the gateware.

\subsection{Low band Amplifier}
The new custom amplififer is designed to allow work with higher signal dynamic
range, because of its variability.  
% A = U^2/(i^2 * R^2) => A_dB = 20*log10(U/(i*R))
In the Fig. \ref{fig:amp_schematics} is shown amplifier's block scheme. All the
settings is controlled via UART interface. It provides changing the variable
current-to-voltage conversion factor from \SI{5.8}{mV/\micro A} -
\SI{1.1}{V/\micro A}. This corresponds to the Voltage gain from \SI{41}{dB} to
\SI{87}{dB}. The AGM ADC has a no zero offset, so the signal can be shifted in the
amplifier before post-processing.\\
The amplifier features also alarm signal generator. This serves to turn of the
gate, when the light impinging is to intense and it could damage the
multi-channel plate inside the PMT. The alarm signal is send to the gateware,
where it is handled. The alarm feature has a variable threshold set.   
\begin{figure}[!tbh]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{amp_schematics.pdf}
    \caption{New AGM custom amplifier}
    \label{fig:amp_schematics}
\end{figure}
The amplifier design has three switches. First switch can set pre-integrator,
to filter out spikes caused by dark counts of the PMT. Second switch can
activate either manual or gate driven integration of the acquisition window.  
Last switch activates low pass filtering with cutoff frequency of 40MHz.

\subsection{Acquisition system}
The DAQ had to be redesigned to be compatible with the new VFC-HD carrier. It
needed Rear transition module (RTM) to control the gate and built-in test LED.  
The Fig.~\ref{fig:bsra_daq} is depicted DAQ functionality principle. 
\begin{figure}[!tbh]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{bsra_daq.pdf}
    \caption{Ackquisition system schematics}
    \label{fig:bsra_daq}
\end{figure}
The new DAQ gets asynchronous data samples from ADC 500MSPS 14-bit (violet
rectangle) in the block of 4 frames every \SI{8}{\nano s} belonging to one
channel. Each frame has 4 x \SI{16}{bit} values. To calculate the integrals of
\SI{100}{\nano\second}, the system tags the data. The tagging block resamples
LHC timing by 500MSPS and creates bunch and turn clock vector masks. Those
store the information about both clocks phases. The 14-bit data from ADC are
left aligned to 16-bit values. The tagger sets their two LSBs to one, when the
ADC sample falls into the edge range. The system stores data from region of
interest, into the FIFO using the synchronization block pulse. Stored data are
then processed as a stream of values passed to the integrator. This starts
summing up values, when it hits the tag in the data indicating the start of the
bunch. It creates 64 values offseted from the pedestal memory (P[63:0]). This
subtracts accumulated charge at the gate opening and closing edge. The values
are then sent to the EMA and the result stored in the block ram available on
the VME64x bus. The format of the data provided to the PC with runnig FESA
server is the same with the current AGM~\cite{my_thesis}.

\subsection{Installation in LHC}
The instrument front and Acquistion system is located in LHC Point 4 near RF
system. The new installation is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:installation}
highlighted with violet frame. On its right side is the currently used AGM
and on the left side is the BSRS. All the instruments share the same light
source with the BSRT. The instrument is pulled out from the shielding and the
red arrow ilustrates, where the light comes from and goes in to the MCP-PMT of
the new AGM.
\begin{figure}[!tbh]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{installation.jpg}
    \caption{New AGM installed in Point 4 next to BSRT}
    \label{fig:installation}
\end{figure}
On top of the reflective foil directing light towards the MCP-PMT
is a LED simulating the light source. This helps verifying the system
operation. The AGM amplifier is placed on top of the optical front-end to be
reachable in case of intervention. For reducing the light intensity, there are
pneumatically controlled optical filters in front of the MCP-PMT. 

\section{Control Interface}
The gateware outputs data from four different block rams. The first stores raw
data from the ADC, that is used correctly set the initial delay of the
instrument's timing. It stores 1.5 turns and therefore it is published with
\SI{3.3}{Hz}. The next two memories store the actual snapshot data and averaged
data, but with finer granularity. They store 10 samples per \SI{10}{ms} window,
which gives the sample rate of \SI{100}{Hz}. The last memory is just bare
averaged data taken every \SI{10}{ms} defining the publishing rate. The
fetching handles the FESA server, which obtains interrupt every time the data
are ready. 
\begin{figure}[!tbh]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{control_interface.jpg}
    \caption{New AGM expert graphical interface}
    \label{fig:control_interface}
\end{figure}
To simplify the setup tunining a new interface had to be created. It runs as
client of FESA server and displays the content of all the block rams. The main
control panel is depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:control_interface}. It displays
three plots, raw data from the ADC (top plot), processed averaged data (down
plot on the left) and and evolution of the data in time (down plot on the
right). The menu on the left controls the amplifier and bottom menu controls
the acquisition delays and optical filters.

\section{First acquired plots}
First measurements were taken in November 2023 on the ion beam. The
optical system splits the SL in ratio 1:8, so the new system gets
significantly less light then current one. In other word, we expect
lower value deviation for system measuring light with higher intensity.  
\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \begin{center}
        \scalebox{0.54}{\input{plots/ions.pgf}}
        \caption{Features comparison of AGMs}
        \label{fig:comparison_chart}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
The Fig. \ref{fig:comparison_chart} shows first acquisition of the new system
in comparison with the current one. The red plot is measured by the current
system and the blue chart is the new acquisition. In a range from 47th - 63th
bin, the gate is already close. There is just white noise, but the red plot
slowly decays and it continues below the zero line. This artefact is caused by
analog integrators and it is non-linear. The new system removes this effect.
The value deviation of the new acqusition from the current system represents
the yellow plot.   The relative value deviation of the new system from the
current one is depicted with the yellow plot. In this measurement the maximum
deviation is 4\% in the area of the decay of the red plot. The the deviation of
2\% in the steep parts can be caused by the sample phase alignment of the two
systems.   

\section{Summary}
The AGM has been implemented on the VFC-HD carrier board simplifying
maintenance. The implementation is based on the direct digital conversion,
which eliminates artefacts in the output plot from the current system using
IBMS cards embedding analog integrators. It also solves the calibration hassle. 
The comparison of the two systems is summarized in the following table Tab.
\ref{tab:system_comparison}.
\input{tables/system_comparison.tex} 
The system is installed in the point 4 next to the current AGM collecting data
to be further analyzed. For the complet reliability test and proper function
verification, it needs to be collected more data and they have to be compared
with the current system. The systems shows so far, that with less light, it can
have still similar results to the current AGM.
