\begin{abstract}
    The LHC Abort Gap Monitor (AGM) is part of the LHC machine protection
    system (MPS) and is designed to measure the particle population in a \SI{3}{\micro\second}
    wide region known as the "abort gap". This region needs to be kept empty to
    ensure safe beam dumps. The AGM captures the synchrotron light generated in
    the visible part of the spectrum and converts it into an electric signal.
    This signal is then processed by an acquisition system and can trigger the
    ‘abort gap cleaning’ process. The current AGM, which has been in operation
    since 2010, uses an analogue integrator ASIC and a 40 MHz
    analogue-to-digital (ADC) converter to provide the particle population
    information. However, this solution is now considered obsolete and is being
    replaced by a digital signal processing approach. Working directly in the
    digital domain not only offers more scalability but also better determinism
    and reliability. This work presents the new technical solution for the
    acquisition chain, compares the characteristics of both implementations,
    and showcases recent measurements conducted on the LHC ion and proton
    beams.

\section{Introduction}
During the flat-top phase, the LHC ring stores up to \SI{350}{MJ} of beam energy,
spread across 2808 bunches with an average beam transverse size under
\SI{1}{mm}. This high energy density can melt metallic surfaces and quench
superconducting magnets, posing a risk to the machine~\cite{LHC_report}. 
To safely extract the beam from the vacuum compartments, a series of kicker
magnets belonging to the beam dump system is used. These magnets take \SI{3}{\micro\second} to
ramp up their magnetic field~\cite{beam_dump_system}. This defines the size of
an abort gap (AG) in the bunch train. Due to system imperfections, a residual amount of particles populates this gap.  The typical AG population levels are two to three orders of magnitude lower in comparison to a single LHC bunch.
When the beam dump is initiated, the particles in AG do not receive full
extraction force. That causes the particles in the AG to deflect towards the vacuum chamber. When a certain energy accumulates in the AG, magnets can quench. Thus,
a~continuous monitoring of the AG population is necessary, which is the purpose
of the AGM \cite{particles_in_ag}.\\
This paper reviews the upgrade of the current AGM system in the LHC since 2010,
focusing on system architecture, analog electronics chain, temperature
dependence, timing instabilities, and a comparison with the upgraded system.

\section{System architecture}
The AGM system consists of three main parts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{optical front-end (OF)}, which includes~a pre-amplifier located beneath the vacuum chamber,
    \item \textbf{data acquisition system (DAQ)} deployed on an FPGA platform located outside the radiation area
    \item \textbf{a~control software (SW)} that retrieves, interprets, and publishes the measured data, facilitating interaction with the instrument
\end{itemize}

The system architecture is illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:bsra_chain}, with each part labelled accordingly.
\begin{figure}[!tbh]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{bsra_chain.pdf}
    \caption{BSRA Chain.}
    \label{fig:bsra_chain}
\end{figure} 
The drawing depicts the layout of the LHC, with beam 1 represented
in red and beam 2 in blue. It includes all four experiments (Alice, Atlas,
LHCb, and CMS). The AGM is located at LHC IP4 (indicated by the yellow
square), next to the CMS experiment. The Timing, Trigger, and Control system
(TTC) is shown as a purple rectangle in the center of the LHC ring. This system
receives RF clocking and broadcasts it into the network (TTC
distribution) through an optical fiber~\cite{ttc_distribution}. The AGM extracts bunch clock 
(corresponding to the position of bunches) and turn clock (marking
the start of a~turn) from the LHC timing block messages.\\
Beam intensity is measured using the synchrotron light (SL) radiation, as indicated by the red line directed towards the Multi-channel photomultiplier
(MCP-PMT) in the optical front-end (OF). The beam traverses first Neutral Density optical filters, which increase the system dynamic range. Subsequently, the signal is
transmitted over a \SI{100}{m}-long cable. To compensate for losses in the cable,
the signal is amplified beforehand. Then it proceeds to the Data Acquisition
(DAQ) system, which integrates the incoming signal in \SI{100}{\nano\second} intervals within a \SI{6.4}{\micro\second}-long acquisition window. This creates a set of 64 values published to
the SW every \SI{10}{\micro\second}.

\subsection{Working principle}
The measurement period is determined by the MCP-PMT used, which is the gated
HAMAMATSU R5916U-50 with a maximum duty cycle of \SI{1}{\%}. With a gate pulse duration
of \SI{3}{\micro\second} and one turn cycle length of \SI{89}{\micro\second},
measurements are taken every $4^{\text{th}}$ clock cycle (\SI{356}{\micro\second}),
reducing the duty cycle to \SI{0.84}{\%}.\\
The system captures 64 values with a granularity of \SI{100}{\nano\second}. The
MCP-PMT gate duration is \SI{3}{\micro\second} providing an additional degree of
freedom in the system control. Each \SI{100}{\nano\second} value is averaged in an
 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and provided to the software every \SI{100}{\micro\second}. This
time is sufficient to react to changes in AG. The population can change from
1.6 to \SI{25}{\second} due to different
effects~\cite{high_sensitivity_measurement}.

\subsection{Current solution}
The current setup employs a DAB64x card with an FPGA Altera Stratix EP1S40 for
data processing. The platform features two FMC connectors, each hosting an IBMS
module, integrating voltage input via the lhcb2002b ASIC~\cite{lhcb_asic}. To
maximize ADC resolution, the signal undergoes amplification using a HAMAMATSU
C5594 amplifier with a static gain of \SI{36}{dBV}, a bandwidth of
\SI{1.5}{GHz}, and a low cutoff frequency of \SI{50}{kHz}.

\begin{figure}[!tbh]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{existing_system_processing.pdf}
    \caption{Current system block diagram}
    \label{fig:current_system_processing}
\end{figure}


The system schematic is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:current_system_processing}.
The OF remains consistent with the description provided
in the system architecture chapter. Note that filters are not represented in the
figure as they are universally applied. For optimal utilization of the \SI{40}{MHz}
ADC's full scale, the MCP-PMT signal requires a~minimum amplification of
\SI{34}{dB}, a task accomplished by the Hamamatsu C559
amplifier\cite{bsra_first_operation}.\\
The signal corresponding to a~single bunch (\SI{25}{ns})
is integrated within the IBMS module (denoted by a~blue triangle with a~capacitor in the feedback loop) and subsequently sampled by the ADC
(represented by a violet rectangle). The DAQ system integrates four samples
(indicated by a~light blue rectangle with a $\sum$ symbol) to compute the
charge over a~\SI{100}{ns} interval. This process generates 64 values, from
which two sets of 64 values are derived, encompassing the standard deviation
and mean value calculations. Both sets are then forwarded to the EMA block (depicted by a green rectangle). All collected data
are stored in a RAM block shared with a front-end computer via VME64 bridge. The PC operates a~server, facilitating the FESA
interface for connected clients.

\subsection{Constraints and limitations}
The present AGM exhibits artifacts in the measurements. Signals outside the gating range do not exhibit the characteristics of white noise, attributed to the lhcb2002b ASIC. The gain of the integrators lacks linearity, featuring distinct offsets and dead times. Consequently, the system requires correction for these effects for each integrator, leading to increased uncertainty of the measurement, necessitating intricate calibration procedures. In addition, the amplifier bandwidth (50 kHz-1,5 GHz) makes it necessary to implement a correction for the missing DC- 50 kHz band to correctly measure AG profiles needed during LHC commissioning phases.\\
The system relies on an outdated FPGA platform, rendering its development
software incompatible with the latest operating systems. Additionally, the fixed amplifier configuration contributes to reduced resolution for signals of smaller magnitudes.

\section{System Upgrade}
To address the long-term maintenance concerns, the original system described above had to be completely refurbished. While the optical path was kept untouched, the DAQ and the front-end amplifier were replaced by a modern solution. Original analogue integrators were replaced by a 500MSPS 14-bit FMC-form factor sampler. The original amplifier was replaced by a DC-coupled amplifier, allowing for dynamic change of the gain. The FMC ADC module is installed into an in-house built FPGA carrier (VFC-HD) featuring 2$\times 8$GBits DDR3 memories and large Arria V FPGA.  Such solution eliminates completely the need for analogue integrators, as all the signal processing can be implemented into the GateWare.  

\subsection{Low band amplifier}

Figure \ref{fig:amp_schematics} illustrates the block diagram of the new amplifier. The amplifier was designed to be highly configurable.
% A = U^2/(i^2 * R^2) => A_dB = 20*log10(U/(i*R))

The configuration is done through an~UART interface, facilitating
setting of a variable current-to-voltage conversion factor. The conversion factor can vary from
\SI{5.8}{mV/\micro A} to \SI{1.1}{V/\micro A}, corresponding to a~voltage gain ranging from \SI{41}{dB} to \SI{87}{dB} in a $50\Omega$ system. The amplifier also implements a programmatic DC-offset compensation, which can be used in the future to extend the signal-to-noise ratio of the measurement. Further, the amplifier provides an alarm signal designed to
deactivate the PMT gate, when the incident light intensity exceeds safe levels. The alarm threshold is as well settable through UART. It is stored into the amplifier's non-volatile memory to be ready at the amplifier power-up. The alarm is transmitted to the gateware for processing and management.

\begin{figure}[!tbh]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{amp_schematics.pdf}
    \caption{New AGM custom amplifier.}
    \label{fig:amp_schematics}
\end{figure}

The amplifier design includes three switches. The first switch can configure
the pre-integrator to filter out spikes resulting from dark counts of the PMT.
The second switch enables selection between a~manual or a~gate-driven integration
of the acquisition window. The third switch activates low-pass filtering with a~cutoff frequency of \SI{40}{MHz}.

\subsection{Acquisition system}
The new acquisition system is housed in a VME crate. The DAQ is composed of a VME-based VFC-HD carrier equipped with an FMC-form factor ADC module. Additional analogue electronics is implemented into a  Rear Transition Module (RTM), installed in the rear of the VME back plane. The RTM implements the PMT gate driver, and a current source used to operate a test light to check the system integrity. The RTM communicates to the DAQ through VME P2 connector. 

Figure~\ref{fig:bsra_daq}
illustrates the principle of DAQ functionality.
\begin{figure}[!tbh]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{bsra_daq.pdf}
    \caption{Acquisition system schematics.}
    \label{fig:bsra_daq}
\end{figure}
The new DAQ receives asynchronous data samples from a 4-channel~500MSPS 14-bit ADC
(shown in violet), as a stream of four frames
every~\SI{8}{\nano s}, each corresponding to one channel. Each frame contains 4$\times$16-bit samples. To compute integrals over 4$\times$~\SI{25}{\nano\second} bunch slots, the system
employs data tagging. The tagging block resamples LHC timing into a 500MHz clock domain, and
generates timing masks, allowing for identification of bunch and turn starts within each individual ADC frame. As the 14-bit ADC data is left-aligned, the tagger can use 2 LSBs of each sample to indicate the position of the start of the bunch or turn.\\
The gateware stores data captured within the acquisition window into a~FIFO using the
synchronization block pulse. The stored data is then integrated. The integrator begins summing values upon
encountering the tag indicating the start of the bunch. In parallel, it reads a stream of 64~values of a stored 'offset' from a pedestal memory (P[63:0]). The offset is on-fly subtracted from the integrated data stream. Such pedestal subtraction is needed to remove measurement artifacts caused by the PMT gate opening and closing. The output values are filtered by an EMA. Results are stored in a format compatible with the previous AGM~\cite{my_thesis}. A dual-port RAM, keeping the results, can be read out through the VME64x bus.

    \label{fig:installation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Installation in the LHC}

The AGM~OF and DAQ are located in the LHC IP4, near the LHC RF system. The
new installation is depicted \textit{in retracted position} in Fig.~\ref{fig:installation}, highlighted by a~violet frame. Adjacent to its right is the currently utilized AGM, while
the longitudinal density monitor (LDM) occupies the left side. All instruments share the same light source
provided by the LHC beam synchronous light telescope (BSRT). The red
arrow indicates the direction of the light entering the entire table.
The light is split using multiple reflective foils into their respective destinations. Both AGM systems are equipped with LEDs installed atop of their reflective foils. These serve to perform functional tests.
The
AGM amplifier is mounted on the top of the optical front-end. This allows for easy access during interventions. The position of the installed Neutral Density Filters is pneumatically controlled.

\section{Control Interface}
The gateware outputs data from four distinct block RAMs. The first RAM stores
raw data from the ADC, crucial for accurately setting the initial timing delay
of the instrument. It holds data for 1.5 turns, resulting in a~publication rate
of~\SI{3.3}{Hz}. The subsequent two memories store both snapshot and averaged
data with finer granularity. They retain 10~samples per~\SI{10}{ms} window,
yielding a~sample rate of~\SI{100}{Hz}. The final memory exclusively stores
averaged data collected every~\SI{10}{ms}, dictating the publication rate. Data
retrieval is managed by the FESA server, which receives interrupts whenever the
data becomes available.
\begin{figure}[!tbh]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{control_interface.jpg}
    \caption{New AGM expert graphical interface.}
    \label{fig:control_interface}
\end{figure}
To streamline setup tuning, a~new interface was developed. Operating as a~client of the FESA server, it showcases the content of all block RAMs. The
primary control panel is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:control_interface}. It
features three plots: the raw data from the ADC (top plot), the processed averaged data
(bottom-left plot), and the temporal evolution of the data (bottom-right plot).
The left menu controls amplifier settings, while the bottom menu regulates
acquisition delays and optical filters.

\section{First acquired plots}
The initial measurements were conducted in November 2023 using the ion beam.
The optical system divides the SL in a~1:8 ratio, resulting in significantly
less light reaching the new system compared to the current one. Consequently,
we anticipate lower deviation values for the system measuring light with higher
intensity.
\begin{figure}[!htb]

        \scalebox{0.54}{\input{plots/ions.pgf}}
        \caption{Features comparison of the present and the upgraded AGMs.}
        \label{fig:comparison_chart}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:comparison_chart} displays the initial acquisition results of the new system compared to the current one. The red line represents
measurements by the current system, while the blue line describes the new
acquisition. Within the range of the $47^{\text{th}}$ to $63^{\text{rd}}$ bin, the gate is closed,
resulting in a~white noise. However, the red distribution gradually decays and extends
below zero due to artifacts stemming from analog integrators,
exhibiting a~non-linear behavior. The new system effectively eliminates this
artifact. The yellow distribution illustrates the value deviation of the new
acquisition from the current system, with the relative value deviation depicted
as well. In this measurement, the maximum deviation reaches~4\% in the region
corresponding to the decay of the red distribution. Additionally, a~deviation of~2\% in
the steep sections may be attributed to sample phase misalignment between the two systems.

\section{Summary}
The new AGM has been integrated onto the CERN BI standard platform VFC-HD
carrier, streamlining maintenance procedures. By eliminating IBMS cards
featuring the lhcb2002b ASIC, the design has addressed issues related to
cumbersome calibration and artifacts in the output plots. The changes in the
AGM design compared to the current AGM are summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:system_comparison}.\\
The system is installed at LHC IP4, alongside the current AGM, collecting
data for further analysis. To conduct a comprehensive reliability test and
verify proper functionality, additional data collection is required. Initial
observations indicate that despite receiving less light, the new system can
still achieve comparable performance to the current AGM.
